# Ideal Citizen: Prologue - The End of the Beginning
### To Kill a Goddess, Book I
By Pedran

### Chapter Summary: 
Little happens which can be truly comprehended by those mortals scattered throughout Existence. People live. People die. Gods rise. Gods fall. Yet Everything happens for a **reason**. Everything happens exactly as it is supposed to.

Until it doesn't. 
 
# The End of the Beginning
 
**The Pinnacle, Nor-Ma**


Energy can neither be created, nor destroyed. Nothing can be gained without first giving in return. 
 
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.
 
That is alchemy’s first law of Equivalent Exchange.
 
It is the fundamental Law of Existence.

This story has almost nothing to do with Alchemists, Alchemy, or the like, but Equivalent Exchange is a universal constant, is it not?
 
A life for a life. That was the deal.
 
She knew it sounded too good to be true. It always was.
 
Everything that had happened, was happening, and would happen... Life.  Always too good to be true. Never could she catch a break. Never could anything good happen without being shortly tainted by something much worse.
 
Everything was always too good to be true.
 
“GIVE BACK MY CHILD!!”
 
Clutching her bleeding abdomen, the girl bound to the Dais of Judgment by steel feathers and gossamer strands raged with unadulterated fury at the massive, hulking being of Light standing above her.
 
**“This birth was foretold. The children must die or the Heavens will fall.”**

*‘Children.’* The girl managed to free an arm from the wings holding her captive and slammed an unarmored fist on the ground, startling the assembly with the crater that formed on the ancient dais beneath her bound form. “Kill my children and I swear on everything Holy AND Unholy that I will **burn** your tainted Heavens to the ground **MYSELF!!**”
 
“**Hmph.**” He replied with contempt. “**Fortunately you will not be around to do so.**” Her Judge then addressed the rest of those assembled. “**She must never be allowed to conceive another such abomination.**”

Solemn and emotionless nods were mirrored throughout the chamber in silence.

“**The executions will commence.**”
 
The trapped girl felt the wind through the air as the blade descended on her neck. She tried in vain to struggle, but the flowing wings of light held her with steely resolve.
 
Strangely, she couldn’t feel the blade’s impact at all.
 
One second she was glaring hatefully at the deceptively white glowing angel and the next her vision was pointed straight upwards.
 
Moisture formed in her eyes as she stared long, precious seconds at the glowing silver, purple, and green cocoons floating only a few feet above.
 
It was beautiful.
 
“Daughters.”
 
Perfect.
 
“I was going to have daughters.”
 
A flash of light followed, blinding the dying girl momentarily.
 
Her last vision was void of her daughters’ trio of cocoons, her captors enacting their judgment with such a cruel efficiency. No mother, even an unwilling one, should ever outlive their child, much less **all** of her children.
 
In the darkest, deepest, and most deadly Pit of the Underworld, twin circles of churning eldritch emerald flashed into existence, trails of smoldering purple smoke following moments later.
 
The Heavens would **BURN**.
 
In the depths of her soul, a haunting melody of anguish, pain, fear, and hatred echoed chillingly.
 
For the first time in time unknown, the darkest of Demon Queens is **laughing**.
