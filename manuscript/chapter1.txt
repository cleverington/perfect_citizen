His battles won, his freedom taken, Peter is finally ready to *rest*.

Orphaned, tortured, ripped from his Happily Ever After, pitted as living M.A.D. weapon against the enemies of a spiteful pair of Goddessess. Empowered to seek Justice in *Her* name, Peter sets out on a journey to his Destiny. Enter the Champion of *Death* *Herself*: **The Hand of Death**
 
### The End
 
**Outside Time and Space**
 
And then the world ended in an explosion. 
 
Boom. 
 
Gone. 
 
Shows over folks, don't forget to tip your waitresses. 
 
The chain reaction caused by that single unplanned explosion lead to the life-supporting star of the Sol System to turn super-nova in a record two hundred years. This unprecedented event caused an equally unplanned Event Horizon a few thousand light-years away, leading to the eventual destruction of the Universe as a whole. As the Multiverse is closer to Primordial Soup than any given organism, the missing chunk of ‘Existence’ caused an even larger chain reaction that led to the current state of Reality.
 
Nothingness.
 
**The End.**
 
**"Pause."**
 
Most people would think that 'The End' is, well, the END. A fairly badly written one at that.
 
**"Rewind five hundred years. Slow playback in fifty year intervals."**
 
Most would, but *She* didn't. 
 
Unfortunately for *Her*, days like this are when *She* has to work the hardest. 
 
*And then the world ended in an explosion. *
 
*Boom. *
 
*Gone. *
 
*Shows over folks, don't forget to tip your waitresses. *
 
*The chain reaction caused by that single unplanned explosion lead to the life-supporting star of the Sol System to turn super-nova in a record two hundred years, which then caused an equally unplanned Black Hole leading to the eventual destruction of the Universe as a whole. As the Multiverse is closer to Primordial Soup than any given organism, the missing chunk of ‘Existence’ caused an even larger chain reaction that led to the current state of Reality.*
 
*Nothingness.*
 
**The E**
 
**"Pause."**
 
**"Rewind five years. Slow playback in six month intervals."**
 
With legs that went 'all the way up', high cheekbones, eyes of the sharpest amethyst, and lustrous silvery hair that brushed the ground as She walked, the woman represented perfection of beauty and grace in humanoid form. Well, She would if She had not been graced with a chest as flat as a washboard and just as boney due to a particularly cruel joke on *His* part.
 
The pair of skeletal wings extending from her sides were the only parts of *Her* body that most mortals ever got right. *She* takes fierce pride in *Her* title and *Her* duties, so days where everything went wrong (like today) irritated the woman to no end. 
 
And then the world ended in an explosion. 
 
Boom. 
 
Gone. 
 
**"Pause."**
 
**"Rewind five minutes. Focus on Reality 759, Nexus: PeRan."**
 
*She* was known by many names throughout Existence over the eons, though these beings for the most part were merely *Her* Avatars scattered throughout the various dimensions, not *Herself*. 
 
Shiva. Kali-Ma. Charon. Ereshkigal. Izanami. Saturn. Hild. Nephthys. Tartarus. Hel. Dispater. Yama. Yomi. Azrael.
 
Death. 
 
The list goes on, but….
 
Honestly?
 
*She* generally just prefers 'Bob'. 
 
To *Her* eternal irritation however, everyone **refuses** to call *Her* that so She generally settled for Momoe.
 
*She* watched with dispassionate eyes as the Nexus grabbed at his chest painfully while his entire body began glowing. *She* eyed the universal clock and noted that his self-combustion occurred at some point in his thirty-fifth year, precisely **forty** years after the Divine spell was cast which caused the explosion in the first place. 
 
**“Interesting.”**
 
*And then the world ended in an explosion. *
 
*Boom. *
 
**"Full stop. Expand. Review file Nexus: HarRan, Sol System, Reality 759."**
 
As they effectively joined *Her* Domain, willingly or not, the universal repairman nicknamed Momoe ripped through Time and Space with gusto to find out just what in the *Creator*'s name went wrong and who could be punished for it. 
 
**"I always wondered how it happened. Stupid egotistical BITCHES!!"** The Aspect hissed in frustration, destroying the last vestiges of Existence in annoyance over one self-involved and narcissistic Goddess's unholy level of pettiness and selfishness. **"I hope you two are proud of yourselves! Ha! Oh wait, you can't be! You're dead! Thanks to you two bumbling idiots Existence just qualified for a Darwin Award!"**
 
When *She* finished ranting (roughly a millennia later, if Time itself had not effectively died before experiencing a nice squicky violation), Momoe decided it was time to go to work. 
 
*She* quickly looked over the time-stream and found the perfect solution already created like a well-built house of cards. The kind ready to crumble. Possibly combust.
 
The second most powerful Aspect of Existence (or possibly most powerful), otherwise known as Death (though preferring the name Bob or Momoe), turned to look to the Heavens and gave a roll of *Her* eyes and a fond smile for *His* foresight. The old letch might be unwilling to permanently put down His children when They REALLY deserve it, but at least *He* is willing to help *Her* do *Her* job. 
 
*He* might be the greatest and oldest pervert ever there was, is, or will be, but *His* unending love for all of *His* children is one of the main reasons why Momoe has always loved *Him*. 
 
Well, beyond the whole '*He is All*' thing. 
 
*She* just wished sometimes *He* would resist the temptation to love all *His* children quite so often or so literally, leaving all those gods and goddesses around to mess with the weaves of reality from sheer boredom or malice.
 
Violating both Time and Space once again (don't worry, They enjoyed it), and subsequently releasing both in a paradox only Momoe, *Her Mother*, or the *Creator Himself* can even dream of getting away with, Momoe implanted a compulsion within the child at the one point in his life where he was effectively closest to Momoe's Domain. 
 
Momoe raised a delicate dark-haired eyebrow when the *She* peered carefully past the Divinity driven spell hiding the human child’s identity. When She finally pierced the spell, She began to laugh uproariously. 
 
The Veil began playing the poor child’s major life-points, but Momoe had in fact watched much of the child’s early life until the human up and vanished one day. The recap certainly explained where the kid went however, as the human had been slated to be murdered via accidental spousal manslaughter before reaching a twenty-fifth birthday. 

What intrigued the Goddess the most, however, was the temporal anomaly she could see in the so-called boy, one that she could not actually pierce the veil of.
