# Ideal Citizen - Chapter 1

### Description: 
His battles won, his freedom taken, Peter is finally ready to *rest*. His summoning by the enigmatic Momoe, whose very Presence drives him to distraction, was as unexpected as it was unwelcome. **Her** words anger the world's Hero completely. Orphaned, tortured, ripped from his Happily Ever After, pitted as living M.A.D. weapon against the enemies of a spiteful pair of Goddessess. Empowered to seek Justice in *Her* name, Peter sets out on a journey to his Destiny. Enter the Champion of *Death* *Herself*: **The Hand of Death**

# The End

## By: Charles R. Leverington \(aka: Pedran\)

**Outside Time and Space**

And then the world ended in an explosion.

Boom.

Gone.

Shows over folks, don't forget to tip your waitresses.

The chain reaction caused by that single unplanned explosion lead to the life-supporting star of the Sol System to turn super-nova in a record two hundred years, which then caused an equally unplanned Black Hole leading to the eventual destruction of the Universe as a whole. As the Multiverse is closer to Primordial Soup than any given organism, the missing chunk of ‘Existence’ caused an even larger chain reaction that led to the current state of Reality.

Nothingness.
 
**The End.**
