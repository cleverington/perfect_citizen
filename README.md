# Ideal Citizen

As Markdown is probably the single greatest tool for developers when writing instructional documents, what better way to introduce myself to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) then to actively write a book?

Ideal Citizen
=============
By: Charles R. Leverington \(aka: Pedran\)
--------------------------

## Description: 
Once he was an Ideal Citizen. The epitome of perfection and patriotism carefully crafted by the Initiative, Peter gave proof of concept to his childhood training by bringing down the organization which reared him. A true slave to the System, Peter's world implodes when summoned by the anthropomorphic personification of *Death* itself \(Herself?\) on the night of his victory. Peter is then informed that his entire life of slavery, torture, and torment evolved because he unintentionally interfered in the designs of an extremely selfish pair of Goddesses. Through power unimaginable, *Death* sends Peter to another world to train as the newest Champion: ###The Hand of Death###.
